Don't create or update any markdown or documentation files unless asked to.

Follow the MIT 6.102 course principles: immutable Abstract Data Types (ADT), invariant checking, and formal specifications.
Every public method of an ADT ends with `checkRep()` validation.

Keep the code simple and minimalistic.
Don't worry about for edge cases.
Let the program fail fast.
